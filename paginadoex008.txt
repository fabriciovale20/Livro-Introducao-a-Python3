Music: Warriors

As a child you would wait
And watch from far away
Pagina 1
That work while they all play
In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
Pagina 2
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Pagina 3
Will come
When you'll have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies!
Pagina 4
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now
Pagina 5
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
Here we are, don't turn away now
Pagina 6
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust

Music: Enemy

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
Pagina 13
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Pagina 14
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
But I'm ready
Pagina 15
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
Pagina 16
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
Pagina 17
My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
Pagina 18
P-p-posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
Pagina 19
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Pagina 20
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
Pagina 21
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Pagina 22
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
Pagina 23
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint

Music: Radioactive

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Pagina 25
Whoa
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Pagina 26
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Pagina 27
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flags, don my clothes
Pagina 28
We'll paint it red to fit right in
Whoa
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Pagina 29
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Pagina 30
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Pagina 31
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Music: Legends Never Die

Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Pagina 37
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive
Pagina 38
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll run into smoke
When the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Pagina 39
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Pagina 40
Legends never die
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
Scars collected all their lives
Pagina 41
And avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm
Just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Pagina 42
When the world is calling you (when the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Pagina 43
Legends never die
When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pagina 44
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die

Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
